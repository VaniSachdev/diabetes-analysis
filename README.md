### tldr: I wanted to apply my R skills to a project with real-world application/analysis!

### Goal:
Diabetes influences 37.3 million Americans. That's 1 in 10 people. Even worse, 1 in 3 adults in America, or 96 million adults have prediabetes. It's the seventh leading cause of death in the US and costs an estimate $327 billion in medical costs ever year. 

Scientifically, diabetes is a serious chronic disease where people lose the ability to regulate the glucose levels in their blood. 
During digestion, food breaks down into sugar in the bloodstream. In a healthy body, this causes the pancreas to release insulin, a hormone that allows sugar to be used for energy. Diabetes is characterized as a problem with this feedback cycle (people are either unable to use the insulin or produce enough insulin). Diabetes has no cure, but early diagnoses and lifestyle changes (ie: losing weight, eating healthier, and being active) can be quite helpful. 

Thus, it is quite evident that diabetes is a disease that affects a lot of people a lot. I truly believe that technology should be used to help people live better quality lives, and I think a statistical deep dive into understanding the inner workings of diabetes can help medical professionals find connections and improve treatements.
